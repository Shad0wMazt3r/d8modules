# d8modules
D8 custom modules for ISU Extension and Outreach sites

Installation Note:
pubs_entity_type uses the slick and blazy modules. These 2 modules use libraries. They should be installed in the web/libraries folder. It's probably possible to install them using composer, however, for now, you need to install them manually, or in our case, using the install script.
